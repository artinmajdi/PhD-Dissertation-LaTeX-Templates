The applications of electric and magnetic fields are widespread.
The goal of this work was to develop the mathematical foundations for static
fields.
Four basic laws are presented which describe the relationships between the
electric flux density, the electric charge density, the electric field
intensity, the magnetic field intensity, the electric current density, and the
magnetic flux density.
A detailed derivation of the corresponding equations is presented, along with a
discussion of their applications.
Experimental results are also shown, which confirm the validity of the
theoretical work.
