SPhdThesis: A Latex template for writing Phd Thesis
===================================================

SPhdThesis is a latex template (document class) for writing PhD thesis. I developed it while writing my PhD thesis in School of Computing (SoC), National University of Singapore (NUS). By default, it adheres to the [NUS Guidelines on Format of Research Thesis Submitted For Examination](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/event/gdthesisexam.html "NUS Guidelines on Format of Research Thesis Submitted For Examination") (Link updated on 31/05/2014). However, it is quite easy to change it for a different guideline.


Downloading
===========
You can download the latest version from ctan or fork it at Github: https://github.com/saurabhg17/SPhdThesis/archive/master.zip.


Getting started
===============
The easiest way to start using SPhdThesis is to copy the example folder and start by inspecting and modifying thesis.tex. figure.tex, table.tex, algorithm.tex files show how to format figures, tables, and algorithms, respectively. example\thesis.pdf is an example of how a thesis looks like using SPhdThesis document class.

For more details read SPhdThesis.pdf. It describes in detail how to use the document class and provide some hints on how to customize it. It also lists some useful tools for working with latex.
