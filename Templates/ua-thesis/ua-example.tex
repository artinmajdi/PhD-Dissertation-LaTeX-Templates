\chapter{Introduction}

Use this manual as a guide for setting up the physical format of your
thesis, dissertation or document. Your thesis will represent you, your
department, and The University of Arizona in the international scholarly
community. Your work is important and worthy of professional presentation.
This manual lists Graduate College requirements for the mechanical aspects
of meeting these high standards.

In this manual the word thesis, includes documents and dissertations. If
format requirements for the document or dissertation vary from those for the
thesis, specific requirements for each type of paper will be listed.

Two final copies of the thesis must be submitted; both must meet all
specifications of this manual. The two final copies should be submitted
unbound in a box to the Graduate College Degree Certification Office.

\chapter{University Microfilms Incorporated (UMI)}

Your thesis will be published by University Microfilms Incorporated, Ann
Arbor, Michigan. Upon certification by your major professor, your examining
committee, and the Graduate College, a copy of the thesis and a Special
Abstract are forwarded to UMI. The manuscript is cataloged and microfilmed,
the microfilm negative is inspected and put in vault storage. Paper copies
of your work will be produced on demand by UMI. Catalog information is sent
to the Library of Congress for production and distribution of catalog cards
for libraries. The original copy of the thesis is returned to The University
of Arizona Library. The Special Abstract is printed in Microfilm Abstracts
and distributed to leading libraries in the United States and abroad and to
a selected list ofjournals and abstracting services.

Publication by UMI does not preclude publication by other means later. You
are urged to submit your work for publication in a scholarly or professional
journal. Suitable acknowledgment must indicate that the publication is a
thesis, dissertation, or document, or portion thereof, which was submitted
in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a degree at the University of
Arizona.

You must complete a UMI publication agreement, available through the Degree
Certification Office.


\chapter{General Format Requirements}

\section{Margins}

Text, illustrations (figures) or tables must not appear outside the
specified margins. Specific margin requirements are listed in ORDER OF
SECTIONS under each category. Page numbers are the only item which may
appear outside the margin requirements.

\section{Corrections on Pages}

Do not use correction fluid or correction tape. These materials flake off in
handling and storage, exposing the original errors.

\section{Page numbers}

The title page is page 1 of the thesis. All pages which follow are numbered
in a single sequence with arabic numerals. Page numbers must be placed at
least 1 " below the top of the sheet, and 1" from the right edge. The
numbers must be at least 1/4" above the first line of text. You may omit the
printed page number on the title page; all other pages must have printed
page numbers. Do not use page headers. Do not use the phrase, Page xx; just
the numeral.

\section{Paper}

See Table \ref{t1}.

\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{}l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}l@{}}

  5. & Cranes Crest Bond - 100\% Cotton Acid Free \\
\end{tabular*}
\hrule
\caption{Required Paper} \label{t1}
\end{table}
  

\section{Photocopy Quality}

Photocopies must meet all requirements for margins, readability, and type of
paper. This includes all photocopied documents, tables, illustrations and
appendix pages.

\section{Printers}

Laser printing or other letter quality printing is required. Impact, or
daisy wheel printing is generally acceptable. 24-pin dot matrix near letter
quality and draft quality printing are not acceptable.

\section{Type Fonts}

Standard serif typefaces such as Courier and Times Roman reproduce and
microfilm well. Do not use modern Sans Serif types, which read well in the
original but do not reduce well for microfilming. Ornamental styles such as
Script and Old English may not be used. Limit the use of italic styles to
standard uses in bibliographic citations and foreign words. Boldface should
be restricted to very small segments of the text and to infrequent
occurrences.

\subsection{Type Size}

Use 12-point or 14-point for proportional fonts; 10 cpi or 12 cpi for
non-proportional fonts. A proportional font allows proportional spacing - a
feature that gives a printed page a more pleasing appearance by allowing for
different widths of characters. The letter w, for example, is wider than the
letter i. Normally, when these letters are printed, both are given the same
amount of space; the result can be gaps that are visually distracting. With
proportional printing, the letter w is given more space than the letter i,
creating a more aesthetic and professional-looking line of text.

\subsection{Typewritten Papers}

Papers prepared on good quality electric typewriters are acceptable. All
margin, paper quality, and typographic requirements apply. Type size should
be Pica (10 cpi) or Elite (12 cpi)

\section{Notes for Table of Contents}

The Table of Contents is required. All levels of subheadings in your
manuscript must appear in the Table of Contents. The TABLE OF CONTENTS for
this Manual contains two levels; your table of contents might contain more.

Margins:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Top 1.5"
   \item Bottom 1"
   \item Left 1.5"
   \item Right 1"
\end{itemize}
Format requirements include:
\begin{itemize}
   \item The heading TABLE OF CONTENTS at the top of the first page of this
     section, and TABLE OF CONTENTS - Continued on each continuation page.
   \item Page numbers at upper right.
   \item Dot leaders .......................... from headings to page numbers.
   \item Indent each level of subheadings 4 spaces from the level above.
   \item Headings in the Table of Contents must exactly match the headings used
     in the body of the paper, and should be typographically the same (e.g.,
     type font and style, capitalization).
   \item Use all capital letters for major headings. (Subheadings may be upper
     and lower case.)
   \item Each Appendix must have its own letter designation and title.
     Appendices are major divisions. The title appears in caps on the left
     margin at the same level of importance as chapter headings.
\end{itemize}
Format options include:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Chapter numbering. You may number your chapters with either arabic or
     roman numerals.
   \item Subheading numbers. If chapters are numbered, you may also number
     subheadings.
\end{itemize}
For example, see Figures \ref{f6} and \ref{f7}.

\end{verbatim}
\hrule
\caption{Example 2 for Table of Contents} \label{f7}
\end{figure}

\section{Notes for List of Illustrations / List of Tables}

These lists, which resemble the Table of Contents, are required if your
thesis contains illustrations, figures, graphs or tables. Include a List of
Illustrations (or List of Figures) for figures, maps and drawings. Include a
List of Tables for graphs and tables. Illustrations or tables which appear
in the appendices only may or may not be included with the List of
Illustrations (or List of Figures) or the List of Tables.

Material in the List of Illustrations is numbered in sequence, Figure 1,
Figure 2, etc. You may construct this sequence as you wish, e.g., Figure
1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.... Use LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS as the title for the first
page and LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS - Continued for subsequent pages. You may use
LIST OF FIGURES instead of LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS if your department prefers.

Material in the List of Tables should be given its own separate sequence of
numbers, Table 1, Table 2, etc. You may also construct this sequence as you
wish. Use LIST OF TABLES as the title for the first page and LIST OF TABLES
- Continued for subsequent pages.

For examples see Figures \ref{f8} and \ref{f9}.

\section{Abstract and Special Abstract Compared}

\subsection{Abstract}

The Abstract is included as a page of your thesis. It is a numbered page in
the thesis, appearing just before the main body of the text. The heading
ABSTRACT is centered at the beginning of the first page. A sample abstract
page follows (Figure~\ref{f10}). Compare it with the Special Abstract
sample.

Margins:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Top 1.5"
   \item Bottom 1"
   \item Left 1.5"
   \item Right 1"
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Special Abstract}

The Special Abstract contains the same text as the Abstract, but is
formatted for microfilming by UMI for Dissertation Abstracts International.
Treat the Special Abstract as a separate document. Include one copy of the
Special Abstract and two extra copies of your title page when submitting the
two final copies of your thesis.

Note the heading of the Special Abstract sample page which follows. Use the
thesis title as it appears on your title page. Use your full name, and add
the appropriate designation for your degree. Include your director's name as
shown (Figure~\ref{f11}).

Margins:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Top 1.5"
   \item Bottom 1"
   \item Left 1.5"
   \item Right 1"
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\hrule
\begin{verbatim}

                          ABSTRACT

   This is the body of your abstract, limited to 150 words

for a thesis, and 350 words for a dissertation or document.

The word count limits apply to the regular Abstract in the

text for both; just adjust the margins and heading.  The

abstract should summarize your work.  The UMI booklet listed

in the resources section of this Manual (here) provides some

writing tips.  The abstract for a dissertation or document

may be longer than one page; word count is more important

than page length in this section.

\chapter{Inclusion of Published Papers or Manuscripts for Publication}

Under a policy adopted by The University of Arizona Graduate Council in
January, 1992, your department may allow published and publishable papers to
be included as part of your thesis. The reprints or manuscripts are treated
as appendices, and the body of your thesis must include a summary of your
contribution and a summary of the research. The Graduate College will accept
theses in this format from any unit with an implementation policy on file
with the Graduate College Degree Certification Office.

\section{Body of Paper}
 The ORDER OF SECTIONS applies. In addition, the Body of the
Paper must include two chapters as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An introduction describing the unique contribution of your work to the
     field of study. Use the following subsections as appropriate:
       \begin{enumerate}
       \item Explanation of the problem and its context
       \item A review of the literature
       \item Explanation of thesis format
          This subsection explains the relationship of the papers included
          and your contribution to each of the papers; where doctoral
          research efforts are part of a larger collaborative project, you
          must be able to identify one aspect of the project as your own and
          demonstrate an original contribution. Your role in the research
          and production of the published paper(s) should be clearly
          specified.
       \end{enumerate}
  \item A chapter titled PRESENT STUDY which summarizes the methods, results,
     and conclusions of the research. The chapter should begin with a
     statement such as:
\begin{quote}
          The methods, results, and conclusions of this study are
          presented in the papers appended to this thesis. The
          following is a summary of the most important findings in
          these papers.
\end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Appendices}
All mechanical requirements for Appendices listed in the ORDER
OF SECTIONS apply. Your appendices will consist of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A reprint of each paper as a separate appendix in the following
  order: 
       \begin{enumerate}
       \item a copy of the title page of the journal in which the article
          appeared
       \item the statement of permission for use of copyrighted material (see
          Appendix B: Permissions)
       \item the reprint(s), copied single-sided onto the required type of
          paper
       \end{enumerate}
  \item Supplementary materials such as data tables, graphs, and maps which
     might ordinarily appear as appendices to a thesis.
\end{enumerate}
These two types of appendices form a single sequence, assigned letters and
titled as described in this manual. All Appendix pages are part of the
single pagination sequence of the thesis. The page numbers will be typed in
as needed.


\chapter{Permissions}

Use of copyrighted material in your thesis, including illustrations, usually
requires written permission from the copyright holder. Start this
time-consuming process as early as possible. Play it safe and assume that
you must obtain permission if the material is copyrighted. Consult your
advisor or departmental graduate secretary about this process.

Exceptions, sometimes pertaining to small fractions of a musical score or
other document, are governed by the concept of "fair use." Factors weighed
in determining "fair use" include: the purpose of the use, whether
commercial or non-profit and educational; the nature of the copyrighted
work; the amount and substance of the material used in relation to the
entire work; and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work. The "fair use" concept is explained in detail
in the Chicago Manual of Style. According to the Association of American
University Presses, permission is required for quotations which are complete
units, for example, an entire poem, letter, book chapter, or an entire map,
chart, drawing or other illustration.

Permission to use copyrighted material should be in writing and retained by
the author. The release letters should indicate that permission extends to
microfilming and publication by University Microfilms Incorporated and that
the copyright owners are aware that UMI may sell, on demand, single copies
of the thesis, dissertation or document, including the copyrighted
materials, for scholarly purposes. UMI requires copies of permission letters
to be attached to the publication agreement, and assumes no liability for
copyright violations. If permission letters are not supplied, copyrighted
materials may not be filmed.

It is polite and good practice to obtain permission to use noncopyrighted
material, which may or may not be acknowledged in the text.

For additional information, telephone the Copyright Public Information
Office in Washington, DC, (202) 479-0700, weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and
5:00 p.m. EST or write to the Copyright Office, Library of Congress,
Washington D.C. 20559.

\chapter{Human/Animal Subjects Approval}

Research involving human subjects or live vertebrate animals requires
permission from the relevant University committee. Consult your research
director for details. If you are working on a project for which your
director has obtained the required permissions, be sure your name is listed
on the protocol approval and that you have the control number of the
approval in your records.

Research activities involving the use of human subjects require the review
and approval of the University Human Subjects Committee. A copy of the Human
Subjects approval letter along with The Human Subjects Research Statement
must be in the student's file in the Graduate College Degree Certification
Office. Questions regarding protocol can be answered by the Human Subjects
Committee. Their telephone number is (602) 626-6721.

Research involving any live vertebrate animals must be approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) - The Animal Research
Protocol Review form must be completed by the student/instructor and
submitted to the protocol office for review and approval. Contact University
Animal Care for instructions, forms and protocol. Their telephone number is
(602) 621-3454

\chapter{Illustrations, Tables, Graphs}

Use illustrative material drawn or computer-generated in black. Color will
reproduce in microfilm as shades of grey; use color only if essential to
convey a significant point in your work. Material may be laser-printed or
drawn in waterproof, permanent ink.
\begin{itemize}
   \item Use labels or symbols rather than color to identify lines on a graph
   \item Use cross-hatching rather than color to distinguish areas on a map
   \item Same margin requirements as Body of Paper
   \item Place the top of a horizontally-oriented page on the left; the page
     number should appear in the normal position (the upper right corner of
     the rotated sheet)
   \item Printed page numbers are required
\end{itemize}
If the caption is so long that it will not fit on the page with the
illustration or table, place it on its own numbered page immediately
preceding the page it describes.

\chapter{Oversized Materials}

Reduce oversized pages, such as maps and pictures, to 8.5 by 11 inches
without sacrificing legibility. If you must include oversized pages, two
options are available:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Include a page 11 inches high, but wider than 8.5 inches, folded once
     or twice. The left edge of the foldout page should be even with the
     other pages of the thesis, and all folds should be made vertically. The
     folds on the right must be at least 1 inch from the right edge of other
     thesis pages to avoid damage to the foldout when pages are trimmed for
     binding. Place the page number in the upper right corner.

  \item If the oversized material cannot be reduced enough for the first
     option, roll it and submit in a sturdy mailing tube. The document must
     be labeled in the lower right corner with:
     \begin{itemize}
          \item Name
          \item Degree
          \item Department
          \item Title of thesis
          \item Date degree awarded
     \end{itemize}
     Use a separate tube for each copy and include the label information on
     the outside of each tube. When you make arrangements with any business
     to have copies of your thesis bound for departmental or private use,
     discuss procedures concerning folding of the oversize material and any
     additional fees which may be incurred for this service. In the LIST OF
     ILLUSTRATIONS use the phrase, in pocket, instead of a page number.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Photographs}

Photographs should be high contrast, low gloss black and white pictures.
They may be printed on 8.5 x 11 inch photographic paper in order to avoid
mounting.

If mounting of small photographs on a standard page is necessary, use
double-sided transparent tape or photographic dry mounting tissue and mount
the photographs on \#67 pliable bristol board. High quality screen prints
or photocopies are acceptable.
