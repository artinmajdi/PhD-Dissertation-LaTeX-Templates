    Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling complex problems across diverse domains. However, real-world applications of machine learning face inherent challenges due to complexity and variability in datasets. This dissertation explores machine learning techniques to address issues in crowdsourced labeling, medical diagnosis, neuroimaging, driver distraction detection, and biological image analysis. The objectives are to develop and evaluate innovative methods that enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of data interpretation. Proposed techniques include a weighted label aggregation scheme leveraging annotator consistency, hierarchical multi-label classification utilizing pathology taxonomy, cascaded neural networks for segmentation, and convolutional neural random forests for classification. By addressing challenges on improving reliability in crowdsourcing, leveraging taxonomic knowledge, transfer learning across modalities, and automating distraction and cilia detection, this dissertation aims to advance machine learning adoption in real life settings. The efficacy of introduced methods is assessed through comprehensive comparisons. By tackling these distinct challenges, this research provides broader insights into real-world applications of machine learning across data science, healthcare, transportation, and biology.
