Accurate diagnosis of thoracic diseases from chest radiographs is a challenging task that can lead to diagnostic errors with negative patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical multilabel classification technique that incorporates a conditional loss function to improve the identification of common thoracic diseases in chest radiographic images. The proposed method leverages a predefined disease taxonomy to account for interrelationships among diseases, enhancing the classification performance of machine learning models. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models without the need for re-optimization, ensuring efficiency and broad applicability. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, experiments were conducted on several diverse and publicly available datasets, including CheXpert, PadChest, and NIH Chest-Xray14. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique significantly improves the precision and interpretability of machine learning models for thoracic disease on chest radiography. This approach has the potential to promote an accurate and efficient diagnosis by providing radiologists with an additional layer of decision support, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
