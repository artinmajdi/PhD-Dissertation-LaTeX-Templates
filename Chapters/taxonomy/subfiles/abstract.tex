Accurate diagnosis of thoracic diseases from chest radiographs is a challenging task that can lead to diagnostic errors and negative patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical multilabel classification technique that utilizes the taxonomical relationship between different pathologies to improve classification accuracy. Two methods are proposed to encompass both scenarios where the ground truth is available (referred to as ``loss'' in this paper) and when it is not (referred to as ``logit'').  The proposed methods leverage a predefined disease taxonomy to account for interrelationships among diseases, thereby augmenting their generalizability to novel tasks.  The ``logit'' approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models without the need for re-optimization, ensuring efficiency and broad applicability. The ``loss'' approach can be incorporated into the existing technique during the training phase by modifying the loss function.  To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, experiments were conducted on three diverse and publicly available chest radiograph datasets (CheXpert, PadChest, and NIH Chest-Xray14). The results demonstrate that the proposed technique significantly improves the accuracy and interpretability of machine learning models for thoracic disease on chest radiography. This approach has the potential to promote an accurate and efficient diagnosis by providing radiologists with an additional layer of decision support, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
