\abstract{Crowdsourcing systems have been used to accumulate massive amounts of labeled data for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, because crowdsourced labeling is inherently dynamic and uncertain, developing a technique that can work in most situations is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel method called ``crowd-certain'', which provides a more accurate and reliable aggregation of labels, ultimately leading to improved overall performance in both crowdsourcing and ensemble learning scenarios. The proposed method uses the consistency and accuracy of the annotators as a measure of their reliability relative to other annotators. The experimental results show that the proposed technique generates a weight that closely follows the annotator's degree of reliability. Moreover, the proposed method uses the consistency and accuracy of annotators as a measure of their reliability relative to other annotators. Experiments performed on a variety of crowdsourcing datasets indicate that the proposed method outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with significant improvement over all investigated benchmarks (Gold Majority Vote, MV, MMSR, Wawa, Zero-Based Skill, GLAD, and Dawid Skene), particularly when few annotators are available.}
